Sign Language Translation
Media has become an integral part of our daily lives. 
There is not a day that goes by without watching a TV show on Netflix,
a commercial on TV or a video on YouTube.
**More than 28 million people in the US alone suffer from hearing loss.**
They are having trouble experiencing media the way we do in our native tongue.
And we decided to do something about it.
Our Project is a chrome-extension that generates sign-language translation next to every video online that has captions.
